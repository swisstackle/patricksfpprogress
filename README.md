# Alain's Functionalpatterns Progress

**Overview**
- **Purpose**: Single-page static frontend that graphs training measurements and shows the latest video per exercise.
- **Stack**: Static site (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`) + optional Node.js helper server (`server.js`) to provide a manifest and proxy a remote CSV source.

**Architecture**
- **Frontend**: `index.html` + `app.js` parse CSV(s), render charts with Chart.js, and embed YouTube videos. The frontend prefers a server manifest at `GET /api/exercises` but can work with local CSV files.
- **Server**: `server.js` is an Express app that serves static files and exposes two helpful endpoints:
	- `GET /api/exercises`: returns a manifest (array) of available exercises. The server builds this from either a remote `DATA_SOURCE_URL` CSV (grouped by `exercise`) or local `*.csv` files in the project root.
	- `GET /data.csv`: proxies the configured `DATA_SOURCE_URL` (if set) so the frontend can fetch it as a local path.

**CSV usage modes**
You can provide data in two supported ways – pick one that fits your workflow.

- **Single grouped CSV** (`data.csv` or any remote URL set in `DATA_SOURCE_URL`)
	- Header columns (recommended): `exercise,ts,value,units,youtubeId,label`
	- `exercise`: logical key used to group rows (example: `broad_jump`).
	- `ts` / `date` / `timestamp`: ISO date or timestamp (e.g. `2025-06-12` or full ISO string).
	# Alain's Functionalpatterns Progress

	This project is a dynamic, data-driven progress site that renders charts and the latest video per exercise by fetching a single grouped CSV. A small Node.js Express server (`server.js`) serves the frontend and helps build a manifest and proxy remote CSVs exported from Google Sheets / Google Drive.

	## Overview
	- Frontend: `index.html` + `app.js` fetch a manifest from `GET /api/exercises`, then fetch the grouped CSV (typically proxied at `/data.csv`) and render charts per exercise.
	- Server: `server.js` fetches the CSV at `DATA_SOURCE_URL` (when configured) and builds the manifest; if the remote CSV is unavailable, the server falls back to a local `data.csv` file.

	## How data flows
	1. If `DATA_SOURCE_URL` is set, `server.js` fetches that single grouped CSV and parses it. It groups rows by the `exercise` column and builds the `/api/exercises` manifest. Manifest entries include `key`, `file` (typically `/data.csv`), `url`, and optional metadata `label` and `units` discovered from CSV rows.
	2. If fetching/parsing `DATA_SOURCE_URL` fails, the server falls back to a local `data.csv` file in the project root (if present) and builds the manifest from that single file.
	3. The frontend fetches the manifest and then fetches the grouped CSV (proxied at `/data.csv`) and groups rows client-side by exercise to render charts and set the latest video iframe per exercise.

	## Google Sheets / Drive specifics
	- Typical `DATA_SOURCE_URL` values are Google Sheets export URLs:
	  - `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<SPREADSHEET_ID>/export?format=csv&gid=0`
	  - Drive direct download: `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=<FILE_ID>`
	- `server.js` contains helper functions for listing files in a public Google Drive folder using a `GDRIVE_API_KEY` and for fetching spreadsheets as CSV, but those helpers are not used by the primary `DATA_SOURCE_URL` flow.

	## CSV format (single grouped CSV)
	- Recommended header: `exercise,ts,value,units,youtubeId,label`
	- `exercise`: grouping key (e.g., `broad_jump`).
	- `ts` (or `date` or `timestamp`): ISO date or timestamp; rows are sorted chronologically before rendering.
	- `value`: numeric measurement.
	- `units`: optional human-readable units string used in chart labels.
	- `youtubeId`: optional; include a full YouTube URL for reliable embedding (client accepts several YouTube URL forms).

	## Server endpoints
	- `GET /api/exercises` — JSON manifest of exercises (array items: `{key,file,url,label,units}`)
	- `GET /data.csv` — proxy for the configured `DATA_SOURCE_URL` (if set and reachable)
	- Static files — `index.html`, `app.js`, `styles.css`, and `data.csv` (if present locally)

	## Notes
	- The runtime data path is a single grouped CSV (remote via `DATA_SOURCE_URL` or local `data.csv`).

	## Environment variables
	- `DATA_SOURCE_URL` — optional. URL to a grouped CSV (Google Sheets export URL is common). When set, the server will fetch this CSV and build the manifest.
	- `GDRIVE_API_KEY` — optional. Drive API key used by Drive-folder listing helpers (not used by the default grouped-CSV flow).

	## Run locally
	Prereqs: Node.js installed.

	1. Install dependencies:

	```powershell
	npm install
	```

	2. Start the app:

	```powershell
	npm start
	```

	To run with a `DATA_SOURCE_URL` inline in PowerShell:

	```powershell
	$env:DATA_SOURCE_URL='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<ID>/export?format=csv&gid=0'; npm start
	```

	## Troubleshooting
	- If the frontend logs `No exercise sections found and no server manifest available`, ensure the server is running and `GET /api/exercises` returns a non-empty manifest, or add a `data.csv` file to the project root.
	- If the grouped Google Sheets CSV fails to parse, confirm the export URL and that the sheet is publicly accessible (or accessible from the server environment). The server falls back to `data.csv` on failure.

	## Adding data
	- Add or edit a grouped `data.csv` (or set `DATA_SOURCE_URL` to point to a Google Sheet export).

	If you'd like, I can commit this README change, start the server locally and show logs, or add a sample `data.csv` file to the repo — tell me which you'd like next.

	````
- `GET /api/exercises` — JSON manifest of exercises (array items: `{key,file,url,label,units}`)
- `GET /data.csv` — proxy for the configured `DATA_SOURCE_URL` (if set and reachable)
- Static files — `index.html`, `app.js`, `styles.css`, and any local `*.csv` files

- ## Notes
- The current app uses a single grouped CSV as the canonical data source (remote via `DATA_SOURCE_URL` or local `data.csv`).
- The repository contains helper code for Drive folder listing and alternate flows, but the runtime data path is the single grouped CSV.

## Environment variables
- `DATA_SOURCE_URL` — optional. URL to a grouped CSV (e.g., Google Sheets export URL). When set, the server will try to build the manifest from this CSV and expose it via `/data.csv`.
- `CACHE_TTL_MS` — optional. Manifest cache TTL in milliseconds (default `60000`).
- `GDRIVE_API_KEY` — optional. Drive API key used by Drive listing helpers if you use Drive-folder-listing flows.

## Run locally
Prereqs: Node.js (to run `server.js`) or any static server to serve the files if you prefer not to use the Node server.

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Start the app (production):

```powershell
npm start
```

3. Start the app (dev with auto-reload):

```powershell
npm run dev
```

To run with a `DATA_SOURCE_URL` inline in PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:DATA_SOURCE_URL='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<ID>/export?format=csv&gid=0'; npm start
```

## Troubleshooting
- If the frontend logs `No exercise sections found and no server manifest available`, ensure the server is running and `GET /api/exercises` returns a non-empty manifest, or add local `*.csv` files.
- If the grouped Google Sheets CSV fails to parse, confirm the export URL and that the sheet is publicly accessible (or accessible from the server environment). The server falls back to local CSVs on failure.

## Adding data
- Add or edit a grouped `data.csv` (or change `DATA_SOURCE_URL` to point to a Google Sheet), or add per-exercise CSV files named `<key>.csv` alongside `index.html`.

If you'd like, I can now:
- commit the README change,
- start the server locally and show the logs,
- or add a sample `data.csv` file to the repo.

Tell me which you'd like me to do next.
